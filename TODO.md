- Fix sql injection problem. For making cookie based authentication I can use the node-session or express-session middlewares
- Show only uninflected forms in the "Example words" list
- Improvements to splitter:
    - Maybe I could improve accuracy considering the kana versions of words that have kanji as "low priority" compared to purely kana ones
    - for example in 大きな蜘蛛が部屋にいるの！早く退治してちょうだい！, ni/iru/no should have priority compared to nii/ru/no because にい could have been 兄 (but what about stuff that has a kanji that's rarely used, like 只?)
    - Another idea: often the splitter screws up when there's a one character particle + a word in kana, so make it so that when splitting "ABCDEF" i try "A" + "BCDEF" as well instead of looking only for the longest word at the beginning.
Grammars to add:
っちゃう (informal て+しまう)
- For each conjugated word, keep the original string (be it with a kanji or not), needed to get the dictionary form of a word starting from its conjugated form
- first proposed reading of 干物 should be ひもの

- Sentences that currently aren't properly split:
    - その男は頑としてその職にしがみつき、決して退職しようとはしなかった。
    - 証人が事実を隠せば刑法の罪に問われる。
    - 彼女の行動はしだいに攻撃的になってくるだろう。
    - この 規則 は いく通り も 解釈 が あります 。

- Add conjugation for "v5", "v5aru", "v5r-i", "v5u-s", "v5uru" 
- The code that calls edict.getReadings() from kanjiLearning.js is copy-pasted three times... Refactor that

- All the objects with that weird addLoadedCallback() thing could be generated by their own Factory, so only the factory works asynchronously, and, for example, the edict object is always guaranteed to be fully loaded and ready
